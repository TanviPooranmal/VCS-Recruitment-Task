### Overview of the CLI

This Go-based Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool is designed to facilitate efficient backup and sharing of directories. The tool offers functionalities for creating backups, encrypting files, and sharing backed-up directories through various data transfer protocols. Below is a breakdown of the design and key functions within the code.

### Key Features

1. **Creating Backups**
    - Running the tool with no flag copies the source directory into a backup directory.
    - Meta-data is stored to track changed files for efficient subsequent backups.
    - Encryption flags enable encrypting files while backing up, with options for recursive and selective encryption.
    - A log file in the backup directory logs all backup activities.
    - Efficient backing mechanism ensures only new directories/files are copied.

2. **Sharing Backups**
    - The tool can share backed-up directories through data transfer protocols.
    - Flags allow specifying which files to send, similar to backup flags.
    - Logger file facilitates creating a new flag for sharing previous backup versions.

3. **Configuration Parameters**
    - Configuration parameters include defining the root directory for the backup and the format of the logger file.
    - A configuration flag enables modification of these parameters.

### Code Overview

The main functionality is split into several functions:
- **backup**: Handles the backup process, including copying files, encrypting if required, and logging activities.
- **encryptFile**: Encrypts a single file using OpenPGP encryption.
- **share**: Manages sharing backed-up directories, allowing selection of files to send and creating logs for sharing previous versions.

The code is structured to handle different aspects of backup and sharing efficiently. It utilizes Go's built-in packages for file handling and encryption. Comments are provided throughout the code to enhance readability and understanding.

### Important Functions

1. **backup**: This function orchestrates the backup process, iterating over files in the source directory, copying them to the destination, and encrypting if required. It utilizes the logger to record activities.

2. **encryptFile**: Responsible for encrypting a single file using OpenPGP encryption. This function is called when encryption flags are enabled during backup.

3. **share**: Manages the sharing process, allowing selection of files to send and creating logs for sharing previous versions. It utilizes configuration parameters and logger for logging.

### Conclusion

This backup tool provides a robust solution for efficient backup and sharing of directories, incorporating encryption and logging features. Its modular design allows easy extension and customization. Detailed README files provide comprehensive guidance on tool usage and design.
